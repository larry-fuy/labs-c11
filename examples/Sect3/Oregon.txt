Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. 
It is located on the Pacific coast, with Washington to the north, 
California to the south, Nevada on the southeast and Idaho to the east. 
The Columbia and Snake rivers delineate much of Oregon's northern and 
eastern boundaries, respectively. The area was inhabited by many 
indigenous tribes before the arrival of traders, explorers, and 
settlers who formed an autonomous government in Oregon Country in 1843. 
The Oregon Territory was created in 1848, and Oregon became the 33rd 
state on February 14, 1859.
